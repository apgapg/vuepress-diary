## Background

One fine evening, when I tried locking my car, I saw the car responded for lock as usual but somehow car was not locked. On closer look, the car lock knobs were still in unlock position.

I switched to driver door, and tried to manually close the lock, but it seems like the door lock knob was stucked. It freezed neither moving up or down. And because the driver door lock is connected to all 4 doors, none of the others were locked.

## Identifying cause

This needed to be urgently fixed as I wasnt able to lock the car. Hence i picked umy screwdriver set (by Taparia) and dismantle the outer cover of driver door.

I took out the lock gun and tried to pull out the lock arm but it was freezed.
So the cause was this faulty gun and probably its internal gears were jammed.

## Repair

After oiling and a bit of hitting hard the gears were free, and the motor arm could now be pulled in and out freely. Looks like it was repaired and I added it back into its original position.

Yay! I fixed it on my own.

## Failure

It worked well few days after but one day it again got jammed, this time in lock phase. I wasn't able to get out.
Hence it was high time to buy a new gun.

## New Purchase

On the very next day I went to spare parts market and to my surprise i wasnt able to find one in any OEM shop. Luckily someone told me that I could find it in car decoration market.

I visited one and got it much cheaper costing only Rs 180. Also its the same in every car as it is a part of Central Locking System rather than car manufacturer itself.

## Happy Ending

On the same day, it took me only 15min to plug it back and appreciate its working. Happiness is when you do it yourself (DIY).
