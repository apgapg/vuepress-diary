# My Hindi Shayari

_Created At: 18 Jan 2022_

Built a Hindi Shayari website for showcasing some of my composed shayari(s).  
Project uses SvelteJs and Tailwindcss as dev frameworks.

## Inspiration

I just felt love with Tailwind. For the first time I prefer tailwind over Flutter UI.
it's so easy to create complex designs with Tailwind.  

Hence thought to create a shayari website and try out the new Svelte framework. And to my surprise its super easy.
Showcasing your work just creates memories and something valuable for yourself.
