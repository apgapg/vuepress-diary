## Introduction

Connect IT platform is developed by Ayush P Gupta(Founder) and Radhey Shyam, the two graduates from IIT Roorkee.

## Problem

Small startups which are at idea level or just startup are not showcased anywhere, mainly because existing platforms are flooded with well established startups which have good recurring revenue and prolific team size. There isn't any place except some groups on social media where one can share his idea or his early staged startup with like minded people. Mainly college freshers or those who lack experience face a lot of challenge in networking, mentoring, building a startup. Nearly all of them fail not because they didn't have idea but they lack resources especially finding team mates

## Solution

Our core focus in only on small scale startups which are idea level or which have just started like having team of 2-4 people. By focusing on this segment we can have a gallery of upcoming, new startups so that people are enthusiastic of knowing startups or those who are willing to join others can benefit out the same.
There are three broad sections in our app:
1. Startup showcase page
2. Feeds section
3. Talent search page

How do you differentiate yourself from the competition?

By focusing on only small startups which are at idea level, or just started we create a line of separation from our competitors

## Vision

To create a complete startup ecosystem or basically a startup kit for a startup. We will . have investors, mentors, incubators, accelerators, summits on our platform which are essential for early stage startups
