# Replacing Speed-o-Meter

_20 March 2021_

## Background

I have a 1993 Yamaha Rx100 model. Currently it has run about 92746 Kms, but since last month its speed-o-meter is jammed. 
Hence I tried fixing it.

## Repair

First and foremost, being a DIY guy, I tried repairing it myself back last month. This repair was quite interesting, I was highly amazed on its engineering.

## Needle

The speed needle is remarkablely the best engineering. It has some magnetic dial which upon rotation generated magnetism which eventually moves the needle to desired speed. With the help of a spring the needle position is controlled and deflected back and forth.

## Speedometer Reading

Speedometer is again the combination of multiple disc with numbers attached in sequence, mounted on an axle. Each disc has mechanism to rotate disc on its left after it completes one rotation.

## Repair Failed

Although I tried fixing it with my best care but due its life end and plastic wore out, it didnt work. Hence it was time to buy a new speedometer which only has one cons ie, reading would start from 0.

## New Meter

New original meter cost around Rs 910 which would provide a complete box which can be directly mounted. Please note you need to take meter light holder and bulb separately.

I replaced my old meter with new and the result is fabulous. Its like a new afresh look and feel of my bike.
