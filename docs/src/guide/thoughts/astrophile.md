# Astrophile

## Meaning

`A person who loves stars, astronomy`

So if love watching sky, planets, stars or great admirer of work done by NASA, then you are an Astrphile.

## Motivation

Ever since I was always fascinated by stars, astronomic events but that much untill I first came to know about **Voyager's Mission**, an attempt to study the most distant planets of our solar system, in 2019. I was highly fascinated about how they are still in contact (as of 2021) after about 40 years of there services.

Thereafter I explored some later missions like New Horizon, Cassini, Hubble Space Telescope and others which deeply lighten my fire to understand and love more about astronomy.

## Education System

The most heart breaking thing that i feel about our current education system is the missing astronomy syllabus and the enthusiastic teachers
