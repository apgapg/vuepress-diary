## Motivation

The bike in the above pic is `TVS Apache`. Apache used to be my dream bike ever since my 11th standard. This bike was like a crush for me and always used to catch my attention howsoever busy I was. This dream made me sketch out my favorite bike on my diary.

I never knew this would be the most liked and near to perfect sketch I would ever draw.  
This sketch is now a part of my wall photo frames.
